An accident reporting demo of various BridgeIt capabilities.

Fill out a vehicle accident report using contacts from your contact list, scan
the vehicle QR code for the VIN, use your device camera to take pictures of the
accident and record an audio description.  Finally, after BridgeIt has made all
this data accessible from the web, the application lets you SMS a link to the
final report which is accessible to anyone with a web browser.

Use your iOS, Android or Windows mobile device to experience the benefit of
native features in a web application.
